# UK Mortgage & Home Buying Process: Comprehensive Research Report

## Executive Summary

This report consolidates key findings about UK mortgages and the home buying process, based on extensive research of current market conditions (as of December 2025). The insights will inform the development of a comprehensive mortgage calculator application.

---

## 1. Interest Calculation Methods

### Daily vs Monthly Interest Calculation

**Key Finding:** Most UK lenders calculate interest daily but apply it monthly.

- **Interest Charging Date:** Set to the same day each month as the mortgage completion date (e.g., if mortgage completed on 10th, interest is charged on the 10th of each month)
- **Daily Calculation:** Interest accrues daily based on the outstanding balance
- **Monthly Application:** The total month's interest is added to the mortgage balance once per month on the charging date

**Critical Timing Consideration:**
- **Payment Date vs Interest Charging Date:** The relationship between when you pay and when interest is charged significantly impacts costs
- If payment date is BEFORE interest charging date: Payment reduces balance before interest is calculated
- If payment date is AFTER interest charging date: Interest is calculated on a higher balance (including previous month's interest)
- This can result in paying more interest overall if not managed properly

### Impact on Overpayments
- Daily interest calculation means overpayments reduce interest immediately from the next day
- Benefits of overpayments are realized quickly with daily interest systems
- Some lenders may take 5 working days to update the balance

## 2. Mortgage Rate Types

### Fixed Rate Mortgages
- **Duration:** Typically 2-10 years (some lifetime fixes available)
- **Current Market (Dec 2025):** Most popular choice, with 88% of outstanding UK mortgages on fixed rates
- **Characteristics:**
  - Monthly payments remain constant during fixed period
  - Protection from rate rises
  - Early Repayment Charges (ERCs) typically apply
  - Usually allow 10% overpayment annually without penalty (some lenders allow 20%)

### Tracker Mortgages
- **Mechanism:** Track Bank of England base rate plus a fixed margin (e.g., base rate + 0.5%)
- **Characteristics:**
  - Move in lockstep with base rate changes
  - Usually no or low ERCs
  - Can be lifetime trackers or for fixed terms (2-5 years)
  - More risky but can benefit from rate falls

### Discounted Variable Rate
- **Mechanism:** Discount off the lender's Standard Variable Rate (SVR) for a set period
- **Example:** 3% discount on 7.5% SVR = 4.5% rate for initial period
- **Characteristics:**
  - Rate can change if lender changes SVR
  - Less predictable than trackers
  - Usually 2-3 year terms

### Standard Variable Rate (SVR)
- **Current Range (Dec 2025):** 6.5% - 8.8% across lenders
- **Characteristics:**
  - Default rate after fixed/tracker/discount period ends
  - Set at lender's discretion (typically 2-5 percentage points above base rate)
  - No ERCs - can remortgage freely
  - Usually 3-5% higher than best fixed deals
  - Most expensive option - should be avoided by remortgaging

## 3. Overpayment Rules & Charges

### Standard Allowances
- **Most Common:** 10% of outstanding balance per year without penalty
- **Variations:** 
  - NatWest: 20% annually
  - Nationwide: 10% annually
  - HSBC: 10% annually (AOA - Annual Overpayment Allowance)

### Calculation Periods
- Typically calculated on calendar year basis (1 January - 31 December)
- Some lenders calculate from the anniversary of the fixed rate start date
- **Cannot carry over** unused allowance to the next year

### Types of Overpayments
1. **Regular Monthly Overpayments:** Set amount added each month
2. **Lump Sum Overpayments:** One-off larger payments
3. Both count toward annual allowance

### Early Repayment Charges (ERCs)
**Typical Structure:**
- **1-5%** of the amount overpaid beyond allowance
- Often tiered by year: Year 1 (5%), Year 2 (4%), Year 3 (3%), Year 4 (2%), Year 5 (1%)
- Some have fixed percentage throughout

**Example Calculation:**
- £250,000 mortgage, 10% allowance = £25,000 penalty-free
- Overpay £50,000 (£25,000 excess)
- ERC at 5% = £1,250 charge on the £25,000 excess

### No ERC Scenarios
- **SVR mortgages:** Usually unlimited overpayments
- **Tracker mortgages:** Often unlimited (but check terms)
- **After fixed period ends:** No ERCs apply

### Impact of Overpayments
Options when overpaying:
1. **Reduce monthly payments** (balance paid over remaining term)
2. **Reduce term** (keep same monthly payment)
3. **Keep both same** (build overpayment reserve)

**Irreversibility:** Overpayments are permanent - cannot be withdrawn

---

## 4. Length of Fixed Rate Period

### Market Standards
- **2-year fixes:** Popular for those who want flexibility or expect rate changes
- **5-year fixes:** Most popular (two-thirds of fixed rate mortgages in Q4 2023)
- **10-year fixes:** Growing in popularity for long-term stability
- **Lifetime fixes:** Available but rare

### Fixed-to-Variable Transition
**Critical Period:** When fixed rate ends
- Automatically moved to lender's SVR unless action taken
- Should remortgage 3-6 months before fixed period ends
- Can lock in new rate up to 6 months in advance

### Remortgaging Considerations
- Start shopping 6 months before end of fixed term
- Factor in potential ERCs if switching early
- Compare product transfer (same lender) vs remortgage (new lender)
- Consider porting mortgage when moving house to avoid ERCs

## 8. Key Considerations for Calculator Design

### Critical Features Needed

1. **Interest Calculation Engine:**
   - Daily interest accrual with monthly application
   - Configurable interest charging date vs payment date
   - Accurate compound interest calculations

2. **Multiple Rate Periods:**
   - Fixed rate period (e.g., 2, 5, 10 years)
   - Subsequent variable rate period (SVR)
   - Rate change transitions

3. **Overpayment Modeling:**
   - Regular monthly overpayments
   - One-off lump sum overpayments (with specific dates)
   - Annual allowance tracking (typically 10%)
   - ERC calculation (percentage-based, tiered by year)
   - Options for impact: reduce term vs reduce payments

4. **Stamp Duty Calculator:**
   - Country selection (England/NI, Scotland, Wales)
   - Buyer type: First-time, home mover, additional property
   - Residency status (UK vs non-UK resident)
   - Band-based progressive calculation

5. **Initial Cost Estimator:**
   - Deposit calculation from LTV
   - Solicitor fees (freehold vs leasehold)
   - Surveys (with type selection)
   - Mortgage arrangement fees
   - Moving costs
   - All other incidental costs

6. **Scenario Comparison:**
   - Side-by-side comparison of different scenarios
   - Ability to vary: rates, terms, overpayments, fees
   - Visual comparison of total costs

### Important Edge Cases

1. **Payment/Interest Date Mismatch:** Calculate impact of timing
2. **Partial Year Calculations:** When fixed period ends mid-year
3. **Overpayment Allowance Refresh:** Annual recalculation dates
4. **Stepped ERC Rates:** Different rates by year
5. **SVR Rate Changes:** Model potential rate changes post-fix

### Data Precision Requirements
- Interest calculations: To the penny
- Dates: Day-level precision for overpayments
- Rounding: Follow UK banking standards (round to nearest penny)

## Conclusion

UK mortgages are complex financial products with numerous variables that significantly impact total costs. A comprehensive calculator must accurately model:
- Daily interest accrual with monthly application
- Multiple rate periods (fixed then variable)
- Overpayment rules and charges
- Payment timing effects
- All initial purchase costs including stamp duty

The key differentiator for this calculator should be its ability to model multiple scenarios side-by-side, allowing users to make informed decisions about mortgage terms, overpayment strategies, and timing of purchases.
